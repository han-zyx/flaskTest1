            <div class="news">

                <p>The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved sweeping, debt-financed tax
                    legislation on Tuesday, sending the bill to the Senate, where lawmakers were due to take up the
                    package later in the evening. Story:The biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system in more than 30
                    years could be signed into law by President Donald Trump as soon as Wednesday, if both chambers of
                    Congress approve it.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>The bill passed the House by a vote of 227-203, overcoming united opposition from Democrats and 12
                    Republicans who voted against it. “The bond market today is reassessing the whole thing now that it
                    looks like it’s going to pass. We’ve had a pretty significant rise in yields - we’re back up close
                    to the highs for the quarter. “Stocks on the other hand have been in front of this for a long time,
                    I think initially because lower taxes means more earnings are retained and then companies can
                    distribute those to shareholders or not.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p> But either way, it’s likely to be beneficial to stock prices.” JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER,
                    BMO PRIVATE BANK, CHICAGO “The tax rate we’ve certainly priced in (in stocks), though I certainly
                    expected smallcaps to do a little bit better coming into this vote. What I think is not priced in
                    yet is the economic impact of the incentives. It still remains to be seen what businesses will
                    actually do. Will they buy equipment, invest in technology, hire more workers?” “The assumption
                    right now is financial engineering, buybacks, dividend increases, is where the incentives will go.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>Redeploying cash, recapitalizing balance sheets, maybe debt repayment.” “I do think there’s a fair
                    amount of skepticism these benefits will ultimately result in expansions. I’m getting a sense
                    investors are pricing in the one-time tax pop, we’ll see if there’s any follow through next year.”
                    On the rise in Treasury yields: “It’s been a monetary policy-led expansion, now we get a fiscal
                    boost and some may be concerned (that) the boost on the fiscal side (may) be offset by monetary
                    tightening.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>“The big question (for the dollar) is how other central banks will respond to this (U.S.) fiscal
                    stimulus package. That’s probably what’s weighing on investors’ minds right now - celebrating the
                    tax package but recognizing that what central banks have given us in the last years they could begin
                    to take away.” JIM PAULSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, THE LEUTHOLD GROUP, MINNEAPOLIS “As we look
                    back on this a little bit, I really think it might be buy the rumor sell the news.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>Wall Street has had long enough to vet this thing. And it has been known for a long time that
                    something was going to pass here, at least for the last 30, 45 days. Whether it was going to be 21
                    percent rate or 20 percent rate is not that significant. It’s more the general parts of it were
                    pretty much known and vetted and I think implemented into the market... If you look at the relative
                    performance in the market today, it’s fairly clearly more of a shot towards better economic growth
                    or even inflation... I think the biggest move today of anything is bond yields. That’s the big
                    story.” AARON KOHLI, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK “They seem to have
                    locked up all the necessary votes
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>I think the markets are still trying to figure out how much should we expect, will people react right
                    away, what will be the second order effects? “There are a lot of questions that still haven’t
                    answered. The first one is, assuming it goes into effect Jan. 1, when is the first time people start
                    seeing any changes in their pay checks? And the answer is it could be a couple of months. Even then
                    for most of middle America you aren’t going to see the savings until tax time, which means you may
                    not see it until April 2019. I’m not sure that’s early enough to help midterms and I think that’s
                    really where the markets’ are going to start to focus next.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>How do we handicap what it does for Republicans in the midterms? Does it help them? Does it do
                    nothing for them? Or it may even hurt them.” BRIAN PEERY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, HENNESSY FUNDS IN
                    NOVATO, CALIFORNIA “The market is taking kind of a breather, digesting the news. The market is off a
                    little bit, maybe because the bill is not as popular as the GOP hoped it would be in the public
                    opinion. The overall market looks still really strong and healthy.”
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>“Looking at companies in our portfolio, (the tax bill) will be great for domestic small- and mid-cap
                    companies paying a 30, 35 percent effective tax rate. A lot of them do not have the ability to move
                    profits offshore... I’ll wait and see how much, but I can see another 5 percent rise (in the market)
                    in the next few months as the tax bill kicks in.” ALICIA LEVINE, DIRECTOR OF PORTFOLIO STRATEGY AT
                    BNY MELLON INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: “The effects of the tax cuts will be immediately
                    accretive to corporate earnings which will support equity markets. Also, the tax package will be
                    positive for growth in the real economy.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>“The tax cuts add $10 to baseline S&P earnings for 2018 putting 2018 expected earnings at $156 or a
                    19 percent growth rate over 2017 earnings... This is supportive of equity markets; sectors to focus
                    on would be small caps, value and financials.” PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT KINGSVIEW ASSET
                    MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO: “It’s pretty much along party lines. The takeaway is more buy the rumor, sell
                    the news.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>The market has been rallying over the last week or so in anticipation of this vote. We’re (now) going
                    to be looking toward the government funding bill.” “It’s going to take time to see how the general
                    population reacts to it (tax). The expectation is companies are going to bring back a lot of dollars
                    back to the United States and put it into plant and equipment. It very well may go into stock
                    buybacks and dividend increases.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>There’s no certainty we’re going to get the promised economic gain everybody’s been talking about.”
                    CHUCK CARLSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, HORIZON INVESTMENT SERVICES, HAMMOND, INDIANA “I think the
                    market had been pretty well expecting this. I don’t think there’s any ... surprise here to the
                    market. The momentum had been pretty strong in the last two weeks in terms of getting this done, and
                    I think the market has pretty well anticipated getting it done.” “You may see some reactions going
                    forward in certain sectors and subcategories. Maybe you see smallcaps pick up a little bit more.
                    Maybe you see the transports, which have lagged large caps, start to do a little bit better. But in
                    the main, the market had already been factoring this in.”
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>“It has a lot of potential ramifications. It’s going to certainly play a role in the midterm
                    elections next year, and people are going to have some time to try to evaluate whether their plight
                    in life is better because of it before they go to the voting booth next year. So from a political
                    standpoint it has impact.” OMAIR SHARIF, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, NEW YORK “This
                    seems like it’s a done deal especially if Corker and Collins end up on board on the Senate side.
                    They will get across the finish line by Christmas after moving the goal post a number of times
                </p>
                </br>
                <p> “I think for more than a few days now, this was likely going to pass. This has been baked in the
                    cake with the markets. They have been expecting this for a long time. It’s a few days before
                    Christmas, so trading is quite thin. I wouldn’t read too much into any market reaction. The real
                    telling thing for this is the second half of next year, whether this actually lifts growth above 3
                    percent on any sustained basis on capital spending and consumer spending. It’s more a political
                    achievement than an economic achievement.” Stocks trimmed losses slightly, but then dipped back. The
                    S&P 500 Index was last down 0.3 percent. Treasury yields hovered near session highs and the dollar
                    held its gains against the yen.
