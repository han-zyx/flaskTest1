			    <p>This is the car Ferrari hope will end their championship drought in 2023.
                </p>
                </br>
				<p>The Scuderia revealed the SF-23 from their legendary Maranello base with drivers Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, as well as new team boss Fred Vasseur and other senior management all present.
                </p>
                </br>
				<p>"Our Valentine is our new car," said Leclerc as a red and black car was revealed, with the latter colour a common theme of this launch season with teams looking to save wait.
                </p>
                </br>
				<p>Both drivers then hit the nearby Fiorano circuit for the car's first laps.
                </p>
                </br>
				<p>Ferrari are aiming to go one better this year after improving to second place in the championship last year behind Red Bull following two years of wallowing in the midfield.
                </p>
                </br>
				<p>F1's most successful and iconic team haven't won a championship since 2007 and failing to claim either the constructors' or drivers' crown this year would make it their longest-ever drought.
                </p>
                </br>
				<p>F1 launches: The cars revealed so far and what's next
			Aston Martin aiming high with new Formula 1 car
			Get Sky Sports F1
Hopes are high, though, for this season.

                </p>
                </br>
				<p>Leclerc, while ultimately falling well short of title-winner Max Verstappen, proved his front-running credentials last year and successfully led the Ferrari team, while team-mate Sainz also won his first race.
                </p>
