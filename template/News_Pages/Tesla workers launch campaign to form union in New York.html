                <p>Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) workers in New York state said on Tuesday they are launching a campaign to form a union, setting the stage for the latest labor challenge for Chief Executive Elon Musk.
                </p>
                </br>
				<p>In a letter to the electric carmaker's management, the employees announced their plan to unionize with Workers United Upstate New York.
                </p>
                </br>
				<p>The union, if formed, would be a first for Tesla, which up until now has managed to avoid unionization at its U.S. facilities unlike other major automakers.
                </p>
                </br>
				<p>Musk has in the past been vocal about his opposition to unions and faced the ire of the U.S. National Labor Relations Board when they directed him to delete a 2018 tweet saying employees would lose their stock options if they formed a union.
                </p>
                </br>
				<p>"We believe unionizing will give us a voice in our workplace that we feel has been ignored to this point," the workers said in a press release on Tuesday. "We are only asking for a seat in the car that we helped build."
                </p>
                </br>
